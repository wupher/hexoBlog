# 文艺版本更新介绍 

这两天Mac App Store中的1Password提示升级了，发现它的升级提示文案真是文艺啊：

>  The Mini Delights Edition
>     
> Sometimes It's the small things that give us the most joy: hearing our kids laugh, brewing the perfect pot of coffee or tea, lining our books up perfectly on their shelves. And sometimes, those small things combine into something truly delightful. That's what 1Password 6.1 is all about: little things that comes together to make one great update.
>     
> == TL;DR ==
> - Many small improvements to make your life even better. See the full details below!
           
> == This is the Login you're looking for ==
> Part of the reason you use 1Password is to make easy to find your login information, maybe even for thousands of sites and services. Things could get confusing if you had many usernames and passwords for the sme site, though. Now you don't have to worry! 1Password will display the Logins's username next to the title if you've used the same title more than once. Go on, sign up for all of the Slack teams you can handle.

     
> == Document smarter, not harder ==
> If you're a 1Password for Teams or 1Password Families member, you'll love this one! Now you can view a list of all of the files you're storing in 1Password using the brand new Documents category. You can link Documents to other items and add notes and custom fields, just like you can with other items. 1Password's here to help you to stay organized!

   
> == Let's sync up ==
> It's important to have your 1Password data at your fingertips, no matter where you are or which device you're using. That's why we keep improving sync. This time around, we've made things more efficient so that 1Password mini can be even more responsive.

     
> == Get off to a good start ==
> Since we were on an efficiency kick, we made the 1Password startup process simpler and more communicative. If something goes wrong when you launch the app, we've added ways for it to detect what's going on and tell you about it.

     
> == More than meets the eye ==
> These are just the highlights! If you'd like to see all of the action-packed goodness, check out the full changelog.

 
> We value your workflow too much to prompt you for a review. If you feel generous of have a couple of minutes, please take some time to leave a rating and review on the App Store. It makes a huge difference to us. Thank you so very much.

    
> We love hearing from you! Get in touch with us at discussions.agilebits.com, @1Password on Twitter, and facebook.com/1Password and tell us about the title things that brings you joy!

附图，话说人家Gemini的版本更新可简约了：
